    * src/loader_fs.c : Minor cosmetic and formatting changes on all files. 
    Also got rid of some signed/unsigned comparison which did not show up using
    the PPC toolchain but do when compiled with gcc under the synthetic target.
    * src/objelf.c :    
    * src/objloader.c :
    * src/relocate_i386.c :

    * include/objelf.h: Include hal_tables.h otherwise we get strange
    linker errors.
    * cdl/objloader.cdl: Rearranged the building of the test case.
    * include/relocate_i386.h (New):
    * src/relocate_i386.c (New): Added a relocator for i386.
    * src/objelf.c: Fixed various Elf_Rel vs Elf_Rela issues.
    * test/load_mods.c: 
    * test/library/hello.c: Modified to make use of the eCos test 
    infrastructure. Uses a romfs to hold the object file to be loaded.
