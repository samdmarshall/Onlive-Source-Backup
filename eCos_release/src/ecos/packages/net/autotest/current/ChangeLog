	* tests/slowpingmux.c (ping_test): 
	* tests/routeping.inl: (ping_test): 
	* tests/floodpingmux.c: (net_test): 
	* tests/autohost.inl (autohost_tell): 
	* host/awaitorder.c (main): Need valid value for sin_len.

2001-10-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/floodping.c:
	* tests/floodpingmux.c:
	* tests/snmpmulti.c:
	* tests/snmppings.c:
	* tests/snmpwalk.c:
	More conditional compilation needed for use of eth0_up, eth1_up
	and the like, since the config opt is now a boolean and so these
	might not exist.

2001-06-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/routeping.inl (route_add_s): Add a close to the socket.
	Don't be upset if you can't ping www.cygnus.com by number!

2000-12-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* host/tftpget.sh (TARGET): Try a little harder to put a correct
	test dataset into the target; we are testing GET not PUT here.  We
	are seeing get fails of 1Mb data on the zeroth try; it could be a
	real get bug, or problems putting the original image.  This change
	should help diagnose which.

	* tests/slowpingmux.c (ping_host): Make this much less verbose in
	[good] output; the farm rejects too much chatter.

2000-11-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/memcheck.inl (memcheck_final): Ignore clusters if
	simulating network failures; I guess memory is used up with
	partial packets awaiting reassembly, and they'll time out.

	* tests/routeping.inl (net_test): Call TNR_ON/OFF() correctly.

	* tests/slowpingmux.c (net_test): Call TNR_ON/OFF() correctly.

	* tests/floodpingmux.c (net_test): Only call TNR_INIT() once.
	Call TNR_OFF(); again after dumpstats() turned it on again.
	Call TNR_ON/OFF() correctly.

	* tests/autohost.inl (autohost_getresults): Add a missing
	semicolon.  Doh!  Only a problem with realtime test harness
	enabled.

2000-11-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* doc/host.txt: Updated.

2000-11-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/net_autotest.cdl: Build the new tests.

	* tests/routeping.inl: New file: the meat of a testcase to check
	that external networks are only accessible if we have added a
	suitable route.  This requires a further network called 10.0.3.x
	attached to the machine that serves DHCP to eth0, and one called
	10.0.4.x on the server for eth1.  These can both be aliases for
	loopback on the linux host if needs be.

	* tests/route_none.c:
	* tests/route_3.c: 
	* tests/route_4.c: 
	* tests/route_3_4.c: 
	New files: Various invocations of the above.  These just make a
	few #defines then #include "routeping.inl"
	
2000-11-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/autohost.inl (autohost_init): Call the memory checking
	init and finalization functions in the appropriate places.

	* tests/memcheck.inl (RATIO): New file; check for mbuf &c leaks
	(if the API is defined in network.h, so it it'll work with the 144
	tarball).  We allow either as much again or 15% of memory to be
	used at the end of the test, for each of the 3 memory regions the
	stack uses.

	* tests/floodpingmux.c (net_test): Don't print out mbuf &c usage,
	leave it up to the memory checking subsystem.

2000-11-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* host/obey.sh: Handle the new case of doing snmpwalk and
	snmpstatus to the target. (SNMP_WALK)

	* cdl/net_autotest.cdl: Build the new tests.

	* host/snmpwalk.sh: New file: snmpwalk the target's public MIB and
	check target status for the timeout.  Much like the other cases.

	* tests/snmpwalk.c: New file: do one snmpwalk session on each
	interface.

	* tests/snmpmulti.c: New file: ditto, 3 sessions per i/f.

	* tests/snmppings.c: New file: ditto, 2 x snmp, plus some pinging
	and flood pinging simulataneously.

2000-11-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* host/obey.sh: Handle the new case of flood pinging the
	target. (FLOOD_PING)

	* host/floodping.sh: New file: flood ping the target, with a
	variable active/sleep ratio so that we can use this to perturb
	other tests also.  An suid executable "./_suping" is needed to be
	able to flood ping automatically.

	* cdl/net_autotest.cdl: Build the two new tests.

	* tests/floodping.c: New file: ask the host to flood ping me, for
	5 minutes in the usual manner.

	* tests/floodpingmux.c: New file: as floodping.c and the target
	floods the host in turn also.

	* host/makefile: Build _suping: it must be set uid &c manually.

	* host/_suping.c: New file: a tiny su root program to run ping
	with real uid root (ping is suid root anyway) to allow us to flood
	the target.

2000-11-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/autohost.inl (XFAIL): Detect the configuration that means
	simulated unreliable network is enabled.  Send the XFAIL parameter
	to the network testing server if so.  Also do not check for the
	count of pass messages required in the autohost_end() routine; we
	expect them to go missing and/or there to be failures per se.

	* host/obey.sh (XFAIL): Detect and pass through the XFAIL
	parameter to indicate simulated unreliable network is enabled.

	* host/tftpget.sh (XFAIL): 
	* host/tftpput.sh (XFAIL): 
	* host/slowping.sh (XFAIL): If XFAIL, do not report failures as
	such; also echo the process ID ($$) in messages to help untangle
	the interleaved status messages.

	* host/sendack.sh (XFAIL): Try less zealously and moan less loudly
	if failure is expected.

	* doc/host.txt: Document XFAIL stuff.

2000-10-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/slowping.c (net_test): New file: 
	* tests/slowpingmux.c (net_test): New file: simple test, the host
	pings the target (a lot, 10x simultaneously), while the target
	also pings the host in slowpingmux.

	* host/slowping.sh (TARGET): New file: handle target side of ping
	testing.

	* cdl/net_autotest.cdl: Build the new tests.

2000-10-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/tftp_serv.inl (do_tftp_tests): Fix typo in info printf;
	nothing of substance.

2000-10-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* permtests/netauto_bootp.ptest: net with bootp only init.
	* permtests/netauto_corrupt.ptest: net + 10% rx corruption.
	* permtests/netauto_failrx.ptest: net + 10% rx discards.
	* permtests/netauto_failtx.ptest: net + 10% tx discards.
	* permtests/netauto_rt.ptest: net + snmp + realtime test.
	* permtests/netauto_snmp.ptest: net + snmp.
	* permtests/netauto_std.ptest: standard net config
	New files; permtest configurations for farm testing.

2000-10-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* doc/host.txt: More info added; kept up to date.

2000-10-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/tftp_serv.inl: New file, the guts of both tftp_serv_get.c
	and tftp_serv_put.c removed to here, so that a number of tests can
	be created to hit the server with different sizes of datafile.
	This is the easiest way to test lots of different filesizes and
	edge conditions; just replicate the testcase.

	* tests/tftp_serv_put.c (FILESIZE): 
	* tests/tftp_serv_get.c (FILESIZE): Use "tftp_serv.inl" with a
	coupla #defines for the op and the filesize to implement the test.

	* tests/tftp_serv_g0.c:   New: get zero and 1-byte datafiles.
	* tests/tftp_serv_g1M.c:  New: get 1Mb and 1Mb-1 datafiles.
	* tests/tftp_serv_g512.c: New: get 512 and 513-byte datafiles.
	* tests/tftp_serv_p0.c:   New: put zero and 1-byte datafiles.
	* tests/tftp_serv_p1M.c:  New: put 1Mb and 1Mb-1 datafiles.
	* tests/tftp_serv_p512.c: New: put 512 and 513-byte datafiles.

	* cdl/net_autotest.cdl: Build all the new testcases to diddle
	different file sizes.

	* host/tftpput.sh (TARGET): Do not read back the file every time;
	check the gotton file once at the end correctly; count up the
	transfers for info.

	* host/tftpget.sh (TARGET): Check the gotton file correctly; count
	up the transfers for info.

2000-10-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* host/tftpdata.src: DELETED: we now make our own data files on
	the fly.

	* host/makefile (tmpfile): Build this.  Also add a make clean.

	* host/tmpfile.c (main): New file: builds to a simple executable
	that makes a scratch file full of random data of the length
	requested.  A simple but order-sensitive checksum is appended,
	though the testcase doesn't use this yet.

	* tests/tftp_serv_put.c (do_tftp_tests): 
	* tests/tftp_serv_get.c (do_tftp_tests): Pass a filesize to the
	test script; it will make a temp file accordingly.

	* host/tftpput.sh: 
	* host/tftpget.sh: Parameterize these more so that they accept a
	filesize; the data file is created with random data.

2000-10-20  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* doc/host.txt: New file.  Details the host side code, scripts,
	environment, tempfiles, conventions, output...

	* doc/strategy.txt: New file.  The original design notes.
	
	* host/obey.sh: Correct typo and add . to the path; stupid
	pedantic environment.

2000-10-20  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/tftp_serv_get.c (net_test): 
	* tests/tftp_serv_put.c (net_test): Use the new API, and remember
	how many host sessions we expected to invoke.

	* tests/autohost.inl (autohost_end): New API to check counts of
	PASS and FAIL statii from the hosts.
