	* src/if_dp83816.c: Use CYG_CPU_TO_LE32 and CYG_LE32_TO_CPU macros
	instead of the _h2le and _le2h functions.

	* src/dp83816.h: #define's for MEAR (EEPROM access) register.

	* src/dp83816.c [CYGHWR_NS_DP83186_USE_EEPROM]: Read MAC address
	from EEPROM.

2004-08-24  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/if_dp83816.c: Enable start/stop functions (device was always
	enabled once configured before)

2004-05-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/if_dp83816.c (dp83816_init): Make ESA diag_printf()
	controlled by DEBUG flag.
	(dp83816_init): 
	(dp83816_poll): Fixed interrupt enable, masking and acknowledges
	so that the driver correctly handles Ctrl-C interrupts in RedBoot.

2004-05-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/if_dp83816.c (dp83816_poll): Removed test for locked up
	transmit engine. This test triggers in otherwise normal situations
	and the warm reset messes things up a lot in both the driver and
	network stack.
	(dp83816_recv): Avoid memcpy() when passed a NULL buffer, this can
	happen when the stack runs out of MBUFs.

2003-10-14  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/if_dp83816.c (dp83816_poll): Try to better detect condition
	where device just stops.  This seems to be related to Rx overruns,
	but there is no status reported.  The best that can be done is
	detect the condition and then reset/restart the device.

2003-10-02  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/dp83816.h: Let default ESA be a pointer, so platforms can more
	easily set it a runtime.

2003-09-30  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/if_dp83816.c: 
	* src/dp83816.h: 
	* cdl/ns_dp83816_eth_drivers.cdl: New package - ethernet driver for
	National Semiconductor DP83816 PCI
