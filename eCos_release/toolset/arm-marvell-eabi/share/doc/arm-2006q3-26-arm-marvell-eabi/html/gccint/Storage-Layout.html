Note that the definitions of the macros in this table which are sizes or
alignments measured in bits do not need to be constant.  They can be C
expressions that refer to static variables, such as the <code>target_flags</code>. 
See <a href="Run_002dtime-Target.html#Run_002dtime-Target">Run-time Target</a>.

<blockquote><p>Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant bit in a
byte has the lowest number; otherwise define it to have the value zero. 
This means that bit-field instructions count from the most significant
bit.  If the machine has no bit-field instructions, then this must still
be defined, but it doesn't matter which value it is defined to.  This
macro need not be a constant.

      <p>This macro does not affect the way structure fields are packed into
bytes or words; that is controlled by <code>BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN</code>.

<blockquote><p>Define this macro to have the value 1 if, in a multiword object, the
most significant word has the lowest number.  This applies to both
memory locations and registers; GCC fundamentally assumes that the
order of words in memory is the same as the order in registers.  This

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>MIN_UNITS_PER_WORD</b><var><a name="index-MIN_005fUNITS_005fPER_005fWORD-1754"></a></var><br>

width of <code>Pmode</code>.  If it is not equal to the width of <code>Pmode</code>,

extended from being <code>POINTER_SIZE</code> bits wide to <code>Pmode</code> are to
be zero-extended and zero if they are to be sign-extended.  If the value

extends a pointer from <code>POINTER_SIZE</code> to <code>Pmode</code>.

      <p>You need not define this macro if the <code>POINTER_SIZE</code> is equal

&mdash; Macro: <b>PROMOTE_MODE</b> (<var>m, unsignedp, type</var>)<var><a name="index-PROMOTE_005fMODE-1758"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A macro to update <var>m</var> and <var>unsignedp</var> when an object whose type
is <var>type</var> and which has the specified mode and signedness is to be
stored in a register.  This macro is only called when <var>type</var> is a
scalar type.

      <p>On most RISC machines, which only have operations that operate on a full
register, define this macro to set <var>m</var> to <code>word_mode</code> if
<var>m</var> is an integer mode narrower than <code>BITS_PER_WORD</code>.  In most
cases, only integer modes should be widened because wider-precision
floating-point operations are usually more expensive than their narrower
counterparts.

      <p>For most machines, the macro definition does not change <var>unsignedp</var>. 
However, some machines, have instructions that preferentially handle
either signed or unsigned quantities of certain modes.  For example, on
the DEC Alpha, 32-bit loads from memory and 32-bit add instructions
sign-extend the result to 64 bits.  On such machines, set
<var>unsignedp</var> according to which kind of extension is more efficient.

&mdash; Macro: <b>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</b><var><a name="index-PCC_005fBITFIELD_005fTYPE_005fMATTERS-1778"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers handle
alignment of bit-fields and the structures that contain them.

      <p>The behavior is that the type written for a named bit-field (<code>int</code>,
<code>short</code>, or other integer type) imposes an alignment for the entire
structure, as if the structure really did contain an ordinary field of
that type.  In addition, the bit-field is placed within the structure so
that it would fit within such a field, not crossing a boundary for it.

      <p>Thus, on most machines, a named bit-field whose type is written as
<code>int</code> would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force
four-byte alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used may
not be four bytes; it is controlled by the other alignment parameters.)

      <p>An unnamed bit-field will not affect the alignment of the containing
structure.

      <p>If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression;
a nonzero value for the expression enables this behavior.

      <p>Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some
bit-fields may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The compiler can
support such references if there are `<samp><span class="samp">insv</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">extv</span></samp>', and
`<samp><span class="samp">extzv</span></samp>' insns that can directly reference memory.

      <p>The other known way of making bit-fields work is to define
<code>STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY</code> as large as <code>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</code>. 
Then every structure can be accessed with fullwords.

      <p>Unless the machine has bit-field instructions or you define
<code>STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY</code> that way, you must define
<code>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</code> to have a nonzero value.

      <p>If your aim is to make GCC use the same conventions for laying out
bit-fields as are used by another compiler, here is how to investigate
what the other compiler does.  Compile and run this program:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo1
          {
            char x;
            char :0;
            char y;
          };
          
          struct foo2
          {
            char x;
            int :0;
            char y;
          };
          
          main ()
          {
            printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n",
                    sizeof (struct foo1));
            printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n",
                    sizeof (struct foo2));
            exit (0);
          }
     </pre>
      <p>If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you would
get from <code>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</code>.

<blockquote><p>This target hook returns <code>true</code> if bit-fields in the given

alignment of the underlying types of itself and of the previous
bit-field; (ii) a zero-sized bit-field will affect the alignment of
the whole enclosing structure, even if it is unnamed; except that
(iii) a zero-sized bit-field will be disregarded unless it follows
another bit-field of nonzero size.  If this hook returns <code>true</code>,
other macros that control bit-field layout are ignored.

      <p>When a bit-field is inserted into a packed record, the whole size
of the underlying type is used by one or more same-size adjacent
bit-fields (that is, if its long:3, 32 bits is used in the record,
and any additional adjacent long bit-fields are packed into the same
chunk of 32 bits.  However, if the size changes, a new field of that
size is allocated).  In an unpacked record, this is the same as using
alignment, but not equivalent when packing.

which are not target-specific fundamental types; it should return

recognize.  If the return value is not <code>NULL</code>, it must point to
a statically-allocated string constant.

codes.)  In both cases the spaces are for clarity; do not include any
