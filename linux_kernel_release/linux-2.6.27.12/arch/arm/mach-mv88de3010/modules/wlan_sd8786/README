DESCRIPTION
	Those commands are used to send additional commands to the Marvell MLAN
	card via the Linux device driver.

	The mlanX parameter specifies the network device that is to be used to 
	perform this command on. It could be mlan0, mlan1 etc.

version	
	This is used to get the current version of the driver and the firmware.

verext
	Retrieve and display an extended version string from the firmware

	Usage:
		iwpriv mlanX verext [#]

	where [#] is an optional argument to retrieve a specific version string,
	omission of the argument retrieves the 0 indexed string.

getsignal
	This command gets the last and average value of RSSI, SNR and NF of
	Beacon and Data.
	Note: This command is available only when STA is connected.

	where value of m is:
		1   -- RSSI (Receive Signal Strength Indication)

		iwpriv mlan0 antcfg 1           : Set Tx/Rx antenna 1
		iwpriv mlan0 antcfg 0xFFFF      : Set Tx/Rx antenna diversity

regioncode
	This command is used to set/get the region code in the station.
	Note: This command should be issued at beginning before band/channel selection
	and association.

	where value is 'region code' for various regions like
	USA FCC, Canada IC, Europe ETSI, Japan ...
	The special code (0xff) is used for Japan to support channel 1-14 in B/G/N mode.

	Examples:
		iwpriv mlan0 regioncode         : Get region code
		iwpriv mlan0 regioncode 0x10    : Set region code to USA (0x10)

wwscfg
	This command is used to set/get the WWS (World Wide Safe) mode.

	where value of m is:
		0       -- Disable WWS mode (default)
		1       -- Enable WWS mode

	Examples:
		iwpriv mlan0 wwscfg             : Get WWS mode
		iwpriv mlan0 wwscfg 1           : Enable WWS mode
		iwpriv mlan0 wwscfg 0           : Disable WWS mode

esuppmode
	This command is used to get the current RSN mode and active pairwise/group 
    cipher for WPA/WPA2 mode.
	Note: This command is available only when STA is connected.

	These are bits settings used to indicate each RSN mode.
		Bit 0    : No RSN
		Bit 1-2  : RFU
		Bit 3    : WPA
		Bit 4    : WPA-NONE
		Bit 5    : WPA2
		Bit 6    : AES CCKM
		Bit 7-15 : RFU

	These are bits settings used to indicate each pairwise and group cipher.
		Bit 0    : RFU
		Bit 1    : RFU
		Bit 2    : TKIP
		Bit 3    : AES CCKM
		Bit 2-7  : RFU

	Example:
		iwpriv mlan0 esuppmode          : Get RSN mode and pairwise/group cipher
		8 4 4
		(The current RSN mode is WPA, active pairwise cipher is TKIP and 
		 active group cipher is TKIP.)

passphrase
	This command is used to set/get passphrase for WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK mode.
	
	Where <n>		
		ASCII string for ssid/passphrase/psk.
	
	1) "0;<ssid=valid ssid>" - This will get the passphrase, AKMP 
	   for specified ssid, if none specified then it will get all.
	            
	Example:
		iwpriv mlan0 passphrase "0;ssid=marvell"

	2) "1;<psk=64 byte hexpsk>;<passphrase=1-63 byte passphare>
	   <ssid=valid ssid>" - Passphrase and psk cannot be provided for the same SSID. 
	   This command takes only one SSID at a time, If ssid= is present it should contain 
	   a passphrase or psk. If no arguments are provided then AKMP=802.1x, and passphrase 
	   should be provided after association.
	   End of each parameter should be followed by a ';'(except for the last parameter) 
	   as the delimiter. If ';' or '/' has to be used in an SSID then a '/' should be preceded 
	   to ';' or '/' as a escape.
	            
	Examples:
		iwpriv mlan0 passphrase "1;ssid=mrvlAP;passphrase=abcdefgd"
		iwpriv mlan0 passphrase "1;ssid=mrvl AP;psk=<64 bytes hexpsk>"

		If user wants to input the ssid as "mrvl; AP" then command has to be
		iwpriv mlan0 passphrase "1;ssid=mrvl/; AP;passphrase=abcdefgh"

		If user wants to input the ssid as "//;" then command has to be
		iwpriv mlan0 passphrase "1;ssid=/////;;passphrase=abcdefgh"

	3) "2;<ssid=valid ssid>" - This will clear the passphrase 
	   for specified ssid, if none specified then it will clear all.
	            
	Examples:
		iwpriv mlan0 passphrase "2;ssid=marvell"
		iwpriv mlan0 passphrase "2"     : Clear all profiles and disable embedded supplicant

httxcfg
	This command is used to configure various 11n specific configration 
	for transmit (such as Short GI, Channel BW and Green field support)

	where <m>
	This is a bitmap and should be used as following
		Bit 15-7: Reserved set to 0
		Bit 6: Short GI in 40 Mhz enable/disable
		Bit 5: Short GI in 20 Mhz enable/disable
		Bit 4: Green field enable/disble
		Bit 3-2: Reserved set to 0
		Bit 1: 20/40 Mhz enable disable.
		Bit 0: Reserved set to 0

	When Bit 1 is set then firmware could transmit in 20Mhz or 40Mhz based
	on rate adaptation. When this bit is reset then firmware will only
	transmit in 20Mhz.

	iwpriv mlanX httxcfg 0x62
	This will enable 20/40 and Short GI but will disable Green field.

	iwpriv mlanX httxcfg 0x30
	This will enable Short GI and Green field.

	The default value is 0x20

	Note:- If 20/40 MHz support is disabled in htcapinfo, device will not transmit
	in 40 MHz even 20/40 MHz is enabled in httxcfg.

htcapinfo
	This command is used to configure some of paramters in HTCapInfo IE 
	(such as Short GI, Channel BW, and Green field support)

	where <m>
	This is a bitmap and should be used as following
		Bit 29: Green field enable/disable
		Bit 26: Rx STBC Support enable/disable. (As we support
			single spatial stream only 1 bit is used for Rx STBC)
		Bit 24: Short GI in 40 Mhz enable/disable
		Bit 23: Short GI in 20 Mhz enable/disable
		Bit 17: 20/40 Mhz enable disable.
		Bit  8: Enable/disable 40Mhz Intolarent bit in ht capinfo.
		        0 will reset this bit and 1 will set this bit in
		        htcapinfo attached in assoc request.
		All others are reserved and should be set to 0.

	Setting of any other bits will return error.

	iwpriv mlanX htcapinfo 0x1820000
	This will enable Short GI, Channel BW to 20/40 and disable Green field support.

	iwpriv mlanX htcapinfo 0x800000
	This will enable Short GI, Channel BW to 20 only, No Rx STBC support and disable Green field support.

	The default value is 0x4800000

	Note:- This command can be issued any time but it will only come to effect from
	next association. (as HTCapInfo is sent only during Association).

addbapara
	This command can be used to update the default ADDBA parameters.

	where <m> is <timeout>
	<timeout> - This is the block ack timeout for ADDBA request. 
		0 : Disable (recommended for throughput test)
		1 - 65535 : Block Ack Timeout in us

	where <n> is <txwinsize>
	<txwinsize> - Buffer size for ADDBA request. (64 is recommended and default value)

	where <o> is <rxwinsize>
	<rxwinsize> - Buffer size for ADDBA response. (16 is recommended value for most APs, 64
			      is recommended for AP85)

	eg:
	iwpriv mlanX addbapara - This command will get the current addba params
	iwpriv mlanX addbapara 1000 64 5 (This will change the ADDBA timeout to (1000 * 1024) us,
			txwinsize to 64 and rxwinsize to 5.

	In case the ADDBA timeout value is updated then a ADDBA is sent for all streams 
	to update the timeout value.

	In case txwinsize and/or rxwinsize is update the effect could only be seen on
	next ADDBA request/response. The current streams will not be affected with this
	change.

aggrpriotbl
	This command is used set/get the priority table for AMPDU/AMSDU traffic per tid.
	This command can also be used to disable AMPDU/AMSDU for a given tid.
	In case of AMPDU this priority table will be used to setup block ack (to make
	sure the highest priority tid always uses AMPDU as we have limited AMPDU streams)

	where <m0> <n0> <m1> <n1> ... <m7> <n7>

	<mx> - This is priority for Tid0 for AMPDU packet. A priority could be any 
		   values between 0 - 7, 0xff to disable aggregation.
	<nx> - This is priority for Tid0 for AMSDU packet. A priority could be any 
		   values between 0 - 7, 0xff to disable aggregation.

	eg:
	iwpriv mlanX aggrpriotbl - This command will get the current Priority table for AMPDU and AMSDU.
						  <2 2 0 0 1 1 3 3 4 4 5 5 255 255 255 255>. This is read as
						  <"Prio for AMPDU for Tid0" "Prio for AMSDU for Tid0" 
						   "Prio for AMPDU for Tid1" "Prio for AMSDU for Tid1" and so on
	iwpriv mlanX aggrpriotbl 2 2 0 0 1 1 3 3 4 4 5 5 255 255 255 255 - 
						This will set the priority table for AMPDU and AMSDU
						Priority for Tid0/AMPDU = 2, Tid0/AMSDU = 2, Tid1/AMPDU = 0, Tid1/AMSDU = 0
						and so on. Aggregation for Tid6 and Tid7 are disabled. 
						Here higher the priority number, higher the priority (i.e. 7 
						has higher priority than 6). Similarly for AMSDU.
	iwpriv mlanX aggrpriotbl 0xff 2 0xff 0 0xff 1 0xff 3 0xff 4 0xff 5 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff - This will disable
						AMPDU for all the TIDs but will still keep AMSDU enabled to Tid0 to Tid5

	A delBA should be seen in case a disable happens on a TID for which AMPDU stream 
	is currently setup. 

	Note:- This command should only be issue in disconnected state.

addbareject
	This command is used set/get the addbareject table for all the TIDs.
	This command can also be used to enable rejection of ADDBA requests for a given tid.

	where <m0> <m1> ... <m7>

	<mX> - This can be 0/1 for TidX. 1 enables rejection of ADDBA request for TidX and 
		   0 would accept any ADDBAs for TidX.

	eg:
	iwpriv mlanX addbareject - This command will get the current table.
	    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]. ADDBA would be accepted for all TIDs. This is the default state.

	iwpriv mlanX addbareject 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 - This command will accept ADDBA requests for
		Tid [0,1,4,5,6,7] and reject ADDBA requests for Tid [2,3]
							
	iwpriv mlanX addbareject 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 - This will enable rejection of ADDBA requests for
		all Tids.

	Note:- This command should only be issue in disconnected state.

txbufcfg
	This command can be used to set max transmit buffer size of firmware. Increasing this
	buffer size is recommended for AMSDU packets. (Default is 2048)

	where <n> is <buffer size in byte>

	<buffer size> - This can be 2048/4096/8192.

	eg:
	iwpriv mlanX txbufcfg 	  - This will display the current buffer size.
	iwpriv mlanX txbufcfg 8192 - This will change the tx buffer size of 8192.

	For AMSDU for work for multiple packets we may need the max tx buffer size to be
	4096/8192.

	Note:- This command should be issue in disconnected state.
           Otherwise, new setting will be effected in next time associate. 
           The actual tx buf size will depends on AP's capability and max transmit buffer size. 

amsduaggrctrl
	This command could be used to enable/disable a feature where firmware gives feedback to driver
	regarding the optimal AMSDU buffer size to use with the current rate. Firmware will use the 
	current rate to decide the buffer size we could transmit. The max buffer size will still be 
	limited by buffer size provided in txbufcfg. (i.e. if the txbufcfg is 4K, then we could only transmit
	4K/2K AMSDU packets, if the txbufcfg is 8K then we could transmit 8k/4k/2k based on current rate)

	If enabled AMSDU buffer size at various rates will be as follows

	1.	Legacy B/G rate.
		No AMSDU aggregation.

	2.	BW20 HT Rate:
		When TX rate goes down, 
		MCS 7, 6, 5, 4:
			a	8K aggregation size (if TX buffer size is 8K)
			b	4K aggregation size (if TX buffer size is 4K)
			c	2K aggregation size (if TX buffer size is 2K)

		MCS 3, 2:
			a	4K aggregation size (if TX buffer size is 8K/4K)
			b	2K aggregation size (if TX buffer size is 2K)

		MCS 1, 0:
			a	No aggregation
		
	3.	BW40 HT Rate:
		When TX rate goes down, 
		MCS 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1:
		a	8K aggregation size (if TX buffer size is 8K)
		b	4K aggregation size (if TX buffer size is 4K)
		c	2K aggregation size (if TX buffer size is 2K)

		MCS 0:
		a	No aggregation

	where <n> is 0/1 (for disable/enable)

	eg:
	iwpriv mlanx amsduaggrctrl 1 - Enable this feature
	iwpriv mlanx amsduaggrctrl 0 - Disable this feature
	iwpriv mlanx amsduaggrctrl (This will get the enable/disable flag
	and the current AMSDU buffer size). The AMSDU buffer size returned is only
	valid after association as before association there is no rate info.

	Note:- This command to enable/disable could be given anytime (before/after
			association). This feature is enabled by default by the driver during
			initialization.

mpactrl
	This command is used to set/get the Tx, Rx SDIO aggregation parameters
	Note: The parameters can be set only in disconnected state.

	Examples:
		iwpriv mlan0 mpactrl       : Get MP aggregation parameters
		iwpriv mlan0 mpactrl 1 1 2048 2048 5 7
		                           : Enable MP aggregation for Tx, Rx

setuserscan
	Initiate a customized scan and retrieve the results

	Usage:
		mlanconfig mlanX setuserscan [ARGS]

	Where [ARGS]:
	  chan=[chan#][band][mode] where band is [a,b,g,n] and mode is
	                           blank for active or 'p' for passive
	  bssid=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  specify a BSSID filter for the scan
	  ssid="[SSID]"            specify a SSID filter for the scan
	  wc="[WILDCARD SSID]"     specify a UNIX pattern matching filter (using *
	                           and ?) for SSIDs found in a broadcast probe
	  keep=[0 or 1]            keep the previous scan results (1), discard (0)
	  dur=[scan time]          time to scan for each channel in milliseconds
	  probes=[#]               number of probe requests to send on each chan
	                           for each broadcast probe required and each SSID
	                           specific probe required (1-10)
	  type=[1,2,3]             BSS type: 1 (Infra), 2(Adhoc), 3(Any)

	Any combination of the above arguments can be supplied on the command line.
	If the chan token is absent, a full channel scan will be completed by driver.
	If the dur or probes tokens are absent, the driver default setting will be 
	used. The bssid and ssid fields, if blank, will produce an unfiltered scan.
	The type field will default to 3 (Any) and the keep field will default to 0 
	(Discard).

	Examples:
	1) Perform an active scan on channels 1, 6, and 11 in the 'g' band:
		setuserscan chan=1g,6g,11g

	2) Perform a passive scan on channel 11 for 20 ms:
		setuserscan chan=11gp dur=20

	3) Perform an active scan on channels 1, 6, and 11; and a passive scan on
	   channel 36 in the 'a' band:
		setuserscan chan=1g,6g,11g,36ap

	4) Perform an active scan on channel 6 and 36 for a specific SSID:
		setuserscan chan=6g,36a ssid="TestAP"

	5) Scan all available channels (B/G/N, A bands) for a specific BSSID, keep
	   the current scan table intact, update existing or append new scan data:
		setuserscan bssid=00:50:43:20:12:82 keep=1

	6) Scan channel 6, for all infrastructure networks, sending two probe
	   requests.  Keep the previous scan table intact. Update any duplicate
	   BSSID/SSID matches with the new scan data:
		setuserscan chan=6g type=1 probes=2 keep=1

	7) Scan channel 1 and 6, for all networks matching the Mrvl*AP
	   or AP*Mrvl? patterns and for MrvlTst SSID.  Generate 3 broadcast
	   probes for the patterns and 3 SSID specific probes for MrvlTst on
	   both channel 1 and channel 6.
		setuserscan chan=1g,6g probes=3 wc="Mrvl*AP" wc="AP*Mrvl?" ssid="MrvlTst"

	8) Scan all the channels for specified band.
		setuserscan chan=0g

	All entries in the scan table (not just the new scan data when keep=1)
	will be displayed upon completion by use of the getscantable ioctl.

getscantable
	Display the current contents of the driver scan table

	Usage:
		mlanconfig mlanX getscantable
		mlanconfig mlanX getscantable [#]
		mlanconfig mlanX getscantable tsf
		mlanconfig mlanX getscantable help

	1) Without argument, the entire scantable is displayed.
	2) Specifying a # will display detailed information about a specific scan
	   table entry.  '0' displays driver cached information regarding the
	   current association (if any).
	3) The tsf argument will display the entire scan table with the recorded
	   TSF timestamp for the entry.
	4) The help argument will display the legend for the capability field.
