Notes for Hackers
-----------------

Here are some quick notes, that may or may not evolve into something more
substantial over time. Development is preferably done via git merges.

* git trees don't contain pre-built config/Makefiles/etc. You'll need to
  run the following (in order):

      aclocal
      automake --add-missing --copy
      autoconf

* Documentation is in SGML source in doc/ so don't edit *.8, *.5 directly.

Prior to a new release:

      Update configure.ac with new version
      prune git tree/commit with new version in configure.ac
      prep tree for tarball
      push to kerneltools.org (along with GPG signed ASC signature)
